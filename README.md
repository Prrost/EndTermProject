# Tic Tac Toe

## Usage Instructions
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game System is designed for a single-player experience, where the user competes against an AI. Below are the step-by-step instructions for how to use the system:

### Start the Game
- Launch the application by running the main Java class (`Main.java`).
- The game interface will appear with a 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

### Making a Move
- As the player, you will interact with the game by clicking on an empty cell in the grid.
- Once a move is made, the system will immediately check if the move is valid. If so, it will update the board with the player's mark (X or O).
- After the player's move, the AI will automatically make its move. The AI selects a random available cell.

### Game Progression
- The game continues with the player and AI alternating turns until there is a win, loss, or draw.
- If the player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed, indicating the result of the game.
- If the AI wins, the system will display a message showing that the AI has won.

### Resetting the Game
- At any point during the game, the player can reset the board by pressing the "Reset" button (if included in the user interface).
- Clicking this button will clear the board and restart the game, allowing the player to play again.

### Ending the Game
- To end the game, simply close the application window.
